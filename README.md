# **Hello, World!**

The files contained in this repository are my assignment for Integrating Bootstrap with Reach, Module 11 Lesson 5.


Overview:

For this assignment, I created 2 simple web pages using React-Bootstrap. The first page created for this assignment is the Home Page and the 2nd 
page is a Not Found page to indicate the product cannot be found. On the home page you will find the name of the product, with a photo of the 
product, and a button to encourage a user to shop for the product. Upon clicking the 'Shop Now!' button a user will be directed to the not found 
page, which mimics the overall color scheme as the home page and includes a friendly image.
